# STIG Fusion
This tool was designed as a quick, simple way to update a DISA STIG Checklist (CKL) file when the underlying STIG is updated by DISA.

#### Usage
  1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Vulnerator/STIG-Fusion/releases/latest)
  2. Unzip the entire folder to a location of your choosing
     * There are files that the application relies on for usage - *do not just extract the exectuable file*
  3. Open the file
  4. Import the old (existing, completed) CKL file, then import a CKL created from the updated STIG - *do not import the raw updated STIG file*
  5. Execute and enjoy!

###### Worthwhile Note
This tool was created by [Alex Kuchta](https://github.com/amkuchta) to satisfy a short-term need - this functionality is currently being built into [Vulnerator](https://github.com/Vulnerator/Vulnerator), which means that this tool may be deprecated in the near future.  *Please check to ensure that all files process as expected prior to utilizing them for an accreditation effort.*

If you come across any issues, please feel free to report them in the issue tracker - Alex will work to correct them, as time permits.
